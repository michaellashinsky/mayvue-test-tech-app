# Mayvue Test Tech App v0.0.1
This was my first attempt at VueJS. It wasn't on the blacklist, shows ES6 knowledge, and illustrates additional complexity. I added _some_ styling based on the Mayvue homepage. My current position is in a regulated industry so documentation is definitely something I do.
## Getting Started

The next few sections provide guidance on how to get up and running. This project was started with the VueJS-cli to quickly template a base site to get to the meat and potatoes.

### Prerequisites

#### NodeJS and npm
Before you start you need to have NodeJS 14.17.6+ LTS along with the accompanying npm tooling.  These can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/).

You can determine that you have the correct versions installed by executing these commands:

For NodeJS
```
node -v
```

should result in:
```
v14.17.6
```

For npm you'd run:
```
npm -v
```
Which should result in:
```
7.24.0
```

#### Installing dependencies
This project relies on the node package manager (npm).  In order to ensure you have the correct versions of all libraries and software you should execute on of the following commands in the root directory of this project:

```
npm i
```

## Running (Local Dev Mode)

This project has the capability of running in a local developer mode.  This is important to note because it can save both time and cost.  It allows a developer to build and test rapidly.  To launch the app in developer local mode simply execute:

```
npm run serve
```

## Production builds
To build a production build you'd run:
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Testing
// TODO ideally I like to work with TDD when possible, but at a min write unit/system tests as part of development.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Contributing

// TODO THIS NEEDS TO BE FILLED OUT WITH MERGES AND PULL REQUESTS (OMITTED due to time constraints)
